### Ahoy!

My name is Ali Brooks, I'm a mathmetician and computer scientist interested in gameplay engineering and computer graphics!


So far, I've worked on Civilization VII and Diablo VI as my AAA experience, but I'm always working on new indie games I throw up on my <a href="https://abrookst.itch.io/">my itch.io!</a>
